# WiFi Ultra-Low Power Stereo Camera (WULPSC) - Main Camera Controller Module
This is the code for the Main Camera Controller (MCC) module. Uses the ``esp-camera`` module to setup the CSI with the OV2640. Connects to WiFi by reading the credentials from the SD card and then creates an HTTP server to send the pictures to a remote server. The MCC connects through two cameras using a custom made PCB with MUXs to connect to only one ESP32-CAM.  The code and software switching of the multiplexers on the PCB would only work on ESP32-CAM due to the RESET pin being hardwired to HIGH.

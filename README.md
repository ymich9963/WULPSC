# WiFi Ultra-Low Power Stereo Camera (WULPSC) - HTTP Functionality
To individually test the http protocol of the system, please use this branch which isolates this functionality. WiFi credentials are required and can be setup in ``wifi.h``.

## Setup Environment
To setup environment for this, please look at the main branch.

## Observations
It is very sensitive to network and if connection is unstable it won't work. It requires an access point with port forwarding port 19520 and connecting to it via the open IP address.

# WiFi Ultra-Low Power Stereo Camera (WULPSC)

## Setup Arduino Environment
The Arduino IDE is used for rapid prototyping and testing for the ESP32 module. To setup this environment follow this [official guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html#installing-using-arduino-ide). This example was adapted from the `CameraWebServer.ino` example. A great guide explaining this example is available from [Random Nerd Tutorials](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-cam-video-streaming-face-recognition-arduino-ide/).
